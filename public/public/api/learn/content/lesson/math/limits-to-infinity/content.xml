        Limits at infinity describe the behavior of a function as the input variable becomes arbitrarily large in the positive or negative direction. In these situations, weâ€™re not interested in what the function equals at any specific point, but rather what value it approaches as the input increases or decreases without bound.
      </p>
      <p>
        We write this behavior using limit notation. For example:
      </p>
      <math
                tex="\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0"
                align="center"
            />
      <p>
        This tells us that as x becomes very large, the value of \( \frac{1}{x} \) gets arbitrarily close to 0.

    <h1>Example</h1>
    <content>
      <p>Consider the following rational function:</p>
      <math tex="\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{3x^2 + 5}{x^2 - 2}" />
      <p>Since the <definition
                    word="degree"
                    meaning="The highest power of the variable in a polynomial"
                >degree</definition> are equal (both quadratic), take the ratio of leading coefficients:</p>
      <math tex="\displaystyle \frac{3}{1} = 3" />
      <p>So, the limit is 3.</p>

      <quote>At infinity, lower-degree terms become negligible.</quote>
      <p
            >For large values of x, terms like "+5" or "-2" have almost no effect on the limit because the dominant term governs the behavior of the function.</p>
